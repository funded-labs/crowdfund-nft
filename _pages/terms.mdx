## 1. Welcome Information

1.1 1.1 Welcome to CrowdFund NFT. The www.crowdfund-nft.com website (“**the Website**”) and the services provided through it are operated and owned by CrowdFund NFT (“**we**”, “**us**” or “**our**” as appropriate). For further information about us and our contact details, please visit the About Us page and see paragraph 21.2 below.

1.2 In order to make these Terms easier to read and understand, we have used some key defined terms: we refer to Registered Users (as defined below) that are seeking to raise funds and offer Rewards for doing so as “**Campaign Owners**”, their fundraising campaigns as “**Campaigns**”, the aims of a Campaign as its “**Campaign Goal**”, Registered Users that support those Campaigns by contributing funds as “**Backers**”, their pledges as “**Contributions**”, the minimum total value of Contributions sought by a Campaign Owner for a particular Campaign as the “**Fundraising Target**”, the maximum period for which Contributions can be made for a Campaign as the “**Fundraising Window**” and the total value of Contributions (excluding cancelled Contributions) that a Campaign has received at the end of the Fundraising Window as “**Total Contributions**”. Registered Users and other visitors to the Website are referred to as “**Users**” or “**you**”, as applicable.

1.3 We provide a platform for individuals and organisations registered with the Website (“**Registered Users**”) to raise funds for Campaigns and to contribute to those Campaigns by funding them. The platform allows Campaign Owners to offer unique benefits (“**Rewards**”) as a ‘thank you’ for this support.

1.4 These Terms of Use are organised into 4 parts. Those in this Section A and in Section D apply to all Users, whether Registered Users or those just visiting the Website. Those in Section B apply specifically to Campaign Owners and Backers and those in Section C apply to all Registered Users. Our Guidelines – which appear on the Website - form part of the terms and conditions that are incorporated in the contract between us (collectively, the “**Terms**”) so please take the time to read them.

1.5 Please read these Terms carefully before starting to use the Website, as they will govern your use of the Website, the Campaigns and Rewards that you create and offer as a Campaign Owner and the Contributions you make as a Backer, as well as the content you post as a Registered User. We recommend that you print or save a copy of these Terms for future reference.

1.6 By using the Website, you confirm that you accept these Terms and that you agree to comply with them. If you are using the Website on behalf of your organisation, the terms '**you**', '**your**' or '**your organisation**' in these Terms are also a reference to the business or other organisation or entity (“**Business**”) on whose behalf you act when using, registering, creating or backing a Campaign on the Website. If you do not want to be bound (or your Business to be bound, where applicable) by these Terms please do not access, use and/or contribute any content to the Website or interact with its Registered Users.

1.7 If you have any questions or concerns regarding these Terms, please contact us using the details in paragraph 21.2 below.

## 2. Access and use of the Website

2.1 Anyone can access the Website. However, to post a Campaign and become a Campaign Owner or make a Contribution as a Backer you will need to register as a Registered User by signing up and creating an account. For that purpose, you must be at least 18 years of age or, if higher, the age at which you would be legally recognised as an adult in your jurisdiction and there must be no reason why you should not be in contact with any other Registered Users. In addition, you are solely liable for ensuring that your use of the Website (and any contract that you enter into via the Website) will not violate any of the laws of either your jurisdiction or our jurisdiction. To create an account, please go to the Sign Up page.

2.2 You will not be eligible to use the Website if we have temporarily suspended or previously terminated your access to the Website and we have not provided you with express written authorisation to resume using the Website.

# B. Creating Campaigns, making Contributions and offering Rewards

This section sets out the terms that apply to the Campaigns that you create, the Contributions that you make in support of Campaigns and the Rewards that you offer.

## 5. Our responsibilities

5.1 What we are responsible for
(a) We provide a platform through which Registered Users can raise finance for their Campaigns and offer Rewards or support those Campaigns by making Contributions and receiving Rewards. By providing this platform, we facilitate agreements between Campaign Owners and Backers for Contributions and Rewards, subject always to these Terms.
(b) Although we may from time to time agree to promote and advertise certain Campaigns or help to raise awareness of their Campaign Goals, we will not be involved in the management of or use of Contributions in relation to a Campaign nor shall we directly offer or fulfil Rewards ourselves.

5.2 What we are not responsible for
(a) Other than as mentioned in paragraph 5.1 above, we do not have any involvement in any arrangements Registered Users make with each other through the Website. We therefore do not accept any liability for the nature or quality of any Campaign or any Rewards or returns, nor do we guarantee that any Registered User, whether Campaign Owner or Backer, will do as they promise. The arrangements you make are solely private and the contracts relating to Campaigns, Contributions, and/or Rewards are made directly between the individual parties concerned. Accordingly, when using the Website, you will be solely and exclusively liable for your arrangements with other Registered Users whom you contact and the nature, extent and terms of your arrangements with them and your obligations to them.
(b) We do not verify the identity of anyone who becomes a Registered User nor the information they provide about their Campaign, any Rewards offered or themselves. We cannot therefore give any guarantee that any of the Registered Users are who they say they are or that the information they provide is true, accurate or complete. Consequently, we make no recommendations or representations in relation to any Registered Users or their Campaigns.

## 6. Campaign Owners

6.1 Creation and modification of Campaigns
(a) Once you have registered as a Registered User, you can create and post details of your Campaign to a publicly accessible webpage on the Website (“Campaign Profile Page”) using the functionality we provide.
(b) We have specific rules regarding the types of Campaigns that you can post on the Website. Please see our Campaign Guidelines which contain these rules and form part of our Terms.
(c) You may not raise funds via another online crowdfunding or similar platform during the Fundraising Window of your Campaign and all Contributions from Registered Users must be made through the Website.
(d) Although we recommend that you have no more than one active Campaign at any one time, you are allowed to post as many active Campaigns as you like.
(e) There is no limit on the Fundraising Target you select for each Campaign.
(f) When submitting details of your Campaign, please note that we will only distribute funds to you if you reach your Fundraising Target. If you do not reach your Fundraising Target, all Contributions will be returned to Backers.
(g) The minimum Fundraising Window that you can choose for your Campaign is 30 days and the maximum is 3 months.
(h) CrowdFund NFT uses a third-party payment processor to process Contributions to your Campaign and to transfer Contributions (minus fees) to you. Any personal information you provide to our third-party payment processor will be processed in accordance with its privacy policies and not ours. Please see our Privacy Policy for further details regarding your personal information and the third - party service providers that we use.
(i) Your Campaign may take up to 5 working days before it goes live and your Campaign Profile Page is made available on the Website. You should note that we will not be liable to you in connection with the Campaign Goal, any Campaign, Rewards and/or performance, promotion and marketing of your Campaign, which all remain solely your responsibility.
(j) Once you have submitted your Campaign details for posting you cannot change its Campaign Goal, the Fundraising Target or the Fundraising Window.
(k) You may post content and other material (e.g. promotional material such as a video containing your Campaign) and post Campaign updates to keep Backers updated on the performance of your Campaign.
(l) You may withdraw a Campaign at any point before the end of the Fundraising Window. Once you have done so, you will not be entitled to any Contributions when you withdraw. You also will not be able to resume that Campaign at a later date whilst retaining funds from any of the Contributions you had received at the time of withdrawal.
(m) We reserve the right, but are not obliged, to attempt to verify your identity and other information you provide to us. In particular, Campaigns or Contributions that are flagged by or to us as fraudulent will be subject to review. If we find fraudulent Contributions have been made to your Campaign, we will cancel those Contributions and remove the details of the associated Backer from your Campaign Profile Page. If, in our sole discretion, we determine your Campaign to be a fraud risk we may also ask you for more information and you agree to respond to such requests and provide such information within a reasonable time. We may also perform an examination before any funds are distributed to you. We will not be liable to you for any losses that you suffer or incur as a result of us taking any of the actions in this paragraph 6.1 (m).
(n) We reserve the right to, but are not obliged to, reject, cancel, interrupt, remove, or suspend an active Campaign at any time and for any reason.
(o) If the Fundraising Window of your Campaign ends without any distribution of funds to you (for reasons other than a breach by you of these Terms) you may choose to recreate your Campaign and repost it for submission.
(p) We do not provide funds for Campaigns and/or offer Rewards to Registered Users. All finance for Campaigns and/or offers of Rewards are made by Registered Users to Registered Users. Should the Campaigns and/or offer of Rewards relate to active or pending legal proceedings we take no involvement in such Campaigns, we do not stand to benefit personally as to the outcome of any Campaign nor do we seek to control Campaigns or their outcomes.

## 6.2 Reward Offers

    (a)	We have specific rules regarding the types of Rewards that you can offer to Backers on the Website. Please see our Rewards Guidelines which contain these rules and form part of our Terms.
    (b)	You can choose whether or not to limit the number of Rewards you offer for each Contribution amount.
    (c)	You must have all the permissions, consents and licences that are necessary to offer all Rewards relating to your Campaign before you offer them on your Campaign Profile Page.

## 6.3 Fees payable by Campaign Owners and receipt of funds

    (a)	Campaign Owners will be charged different types of fees, which are described in detail on our Fees page. The Fees page forms part of our Terms. Where the relevant fees are not payable in advance, these fees will be deducted from the Contributions we receive for your Campaign before they are distributed to you. In brief, Campaign Owners will be charged:
        (i)	A flat fee to submit a Campaign for review (a ‘Submission Fee’);
        (ii) An ICP transaction fee (a ‘Transaction Fee’);
        (iii) A percentage fee for successfully funded Campaigns (a ‘Success Fee’); and
        (iv) A royalty fee for NFT’s sold on secondary marketplaces (a ‘Royalty Fee’).
        (b)	All fees payable by Campaign Owners are subject to Value Added Tax (“VAT”) at the applicable rate in force from time to time. Please note that VAT is assessed on the above fees and not the Total Contributions raised and you are solely responsible for ensuring that you are registered for VAT or similar sales tax as required by the applicable laws of the jurisdiction in which your Business is established.
        (c)	If the Total Contributions meet or exceed the Fundraising Target at the end of the Fundraising Window, the amounts due to Campaign Owners will be transferred to Campaign Owners within approximately 10 working days in ICP tokens to a wallet designated for you by us.
        (d)	Please note that the above timescale is an estimate only and there may be a delay between the end of the Fundraising Window for a successful Campaign and your access to any funds.

## 6.4 Contributions

    (a)	Backers may fail to fulfil payment of Contributions and you acknowledge that their payment of Contributions is entirely outside of our control. Consequently, we cannot guarantee and shall have no liability to any Campaign Owner for their failure to receive any funds contributed by Backers in relation to their Campaign(s) via the Website.
    (b)	In the event we are unable to verify any information to our satisfaction, we may delay, withhold, cancel or refund any Contributions or other amounts without giving any notice to you and do so without incurring any liability to you.
    (c)	Campaign Owners may contact us to cancel any Contribution for any reason and at any time before the Fundraising Window ends or the Campaign otherwise successfully closes and shall not be required to fulfil any related Rewards if they do so. After the Fundraising Window has ended or the Campaign successfully closes and the amounts due from Contributions have been transferred to a Campaign Owner, that Campaign Owner will be responsible for refunding any amounts to Backers.
    (d)	If your Campaign does not reach its Fundraising Target by the end of the Fundraising Window, any Contributions made by Backers for the Campaign will be cancelled and you will not be entitled to receive any funds in respect of them.
    (e)	We are not tax, accounting or financial advisers and you should not rely on information in these Terms or that otherwise appears on the Website to determine the tax, accounting or financial treatment of any Contributions you receive using the Website. Please seek advice from an appropriately qualified professional if you are unsure in respect of any of these matters.

## 6.5 Communications with Backers and personal information we share with you relating to Backers

    (a)	We will make available to you via your account, details of each Backer that makes a Contribution to your Campaign, which may include personal data relating to those Backers (including their name, email address, date and amount of their Contribution and any comments they make). You acknowledge that your processing of that personal data during and after the Fundraising Window including during the course of your Campaign (e.g. to keep in contact with Backers about the progress of your Campaign and your achievements) is processing for which you determine the purpose and means, independently of us. As a result, for the purposes of data protection and privacy laws, you are a separate controller of that personal data when using it for your own purposes and you shall ensure that you comply with all such laws in relation to the use of that personal data. In particular, you shall ensure that you do not contact individuals with any marketing materials without their consent where such consent is required by law.
    (b)	We will make available to you functionality within your account that allows you to send emails or messages to Backers. To the extent that we are, for the purposes of data protection law, a processor of the personal data we process when you use this functionality, the relevant provisions of our Privacy Policy will apply.

## 6.6 Campaign Owners’ Obligations

    (a)	As a Campaign Owner, you shall:
        (i)	apply any funds you receive from Backers solely and exclusively for the purpose of achieving the Campaign Goals and for no other purposes;
        (ii) meet all commitments you make in your Campaign including, but not limited to, delivering all Rewards that you offer to Backers;
        (iii) use your best endeavours to fulfil each Reward by the estimated fulfilment or delivery date (as applicable) specified by you on the applicable Campaign Profile Page.
        (iv) promptly and accurately respond in full and to our satisfaction to all questions or requests for clarification made by us and/or any Backer;
        (v)	comply with all of your obligations as a ‘controller’ of personal data under all relevant data protection and privacy laws, including by providing appropriate privacy information to all Backers whose personal data you receive through the Website;
        (vi) promptly contact and work with Backers in order to reach a mutually satisfactory resolution, which may include refunding their Contributions if you are unable to fulfil any of your commitments (including providing any Rewards);
        (vii) comply with all applicable laws and regulations in relation to your Campaign, your use of Contributions and your offer and fulfilment of Rewards;
        (viii) be responsible for paying all fees and collecting and remitting all applicable taxes (including income tax and VAT or similar taxes) connected with your use of the Website, the Contributions you receive and the Rewards you offer;
        (ix) where you have received any Contributions, be responsible for issuing refunds of Contributions to and responding to requests for refunds of Contributions from, Backers;
        (x) not take any action or make any business or other decision in reliance on having your Campaign posted on the Website or on receiving any funds from Contributions until you have received the funds into your wallet; and
        (xi) provide all assistance and co-operation requested by us from time to time, including by providing us with copies of any records or information held by you, in particular with respect to any regulatory inquiry, audit or investigation.

## 7. Backers

7.1 Making a Contribution
(a) Once you have registered as a Registered User, you can make a Contribution by visiting the Campaign Profile Page of a Campaign, selecting the amount you wish to contribute and the Reward you would like to receive and then submitting payment.  
 (b) Your username will be made publicly available in connection with each Campaign for which you make a Contribution unless you choose to make a Contribution anonymously. If you do make an anonymous Contribution, although your details will not be published on the Website, your details will still be shared with the relevant Campaign Owner.
(c) You acknowledge that your Contribution does not entitle you to any rights in or to any Campaign, including any ownership, control or intellectual property rights.

7.2 Rewards

Once you have made a Contribution, you cannot change your selected Reward without cancelling your Contribution.

7.3 Payment methods
(a) Once you have confirmed the amount you wish to make as a Contribution, you will be prompted to pay via our third-party payment provider. Any personal information you provide to our third-party payment provider will be processed in accordance with its privacy policies and not ours. Please see our Privacy Policy for further details regarding your personal information and the third-party service providers that we use.
(b) When making your Contribution, you will be transferring ICP tokens into a CrowdFund NFT – owned escrow wallet. We shall thereafter be responsible for distributing funds to Campaign Owners and for issuing refunds while the Campaign is open.

7.4 Cancelling a Contribution and Refunds
(a) You may cancel a Contribution without charge at any time before the end of the Fundraising Window for a Campaign, whether it has reached its Fundraising Target or not. If you do so, you will not be eligible to receive any Rewards in relation to your Contribution.
(b) You may not cancel your Contribution once a Campaign’s Fundraising Window has ended if at the end of the Fundraising Window the Campaign is deemed funded. This does not affect your statutory or legal rights. Advice about these rights is available from your local Citizens' Advice Bureau or Trading Standards office.
(c) Once your Contribution has been distributed to a Campaign Owner, the Campaign Owner shall be solely responsible for issuing, and responding to requests for, any refunds of Contributions. We shall not be liable for any Campaign Owners’ failure to issue any refunds of Contributions to you.

(iii) ensure that any funds used to make Contributions will not result in a breach of applicable law; and
(iv) ensure that by making a Contribution, you are not issuing a security in your jurisdiction, nor doing anything that might amount to the issuance of a security in your jurisdiction.

## 8. Additional important terms

8.1 The contract between Campaign Owners and Backers
(a) The contract relating to the provision of funds from Contributions and the fulfilment of Rewards is made solely between a Campaign Owner and Backers, subject always to these Terms. By making a Contribution, a Backer is making an offer to enter into a contract with the applicable Campaign Owner.
(b) The following steps have to take place before a contract is made between the Backer and the Campaign Owner:
(i) after signing into their account the Backer makes a Contribution by submitting their payment details for processing and transferring ICP tokens into a CrowdFund NFT – owned escrow wallet. Before making their Contribution, the Backer will have the opportunity to review the Contribution amount and any related Reward and, if necessary, to amend these details; and
(ii) the Backer will see an on-screen acknowledgement of their Contribution.
(c) The Campaign Owner accepts the Backer’s offer, and a binding contract is made between them, at the time the Fundraising Window ends. Accordingly, nothing that we or the Campaign Owner says or does will amount to any acceptance of a Backer’s offer until the relevant event listed above in this paragraph occurs.

8.2 Interest on Contributions
(a) Any interest or other gains on Contributions or other funds held by us shall accrue to our benefit and neither Campaign Owners nor Backers shall be entitled to such interest or remittance of any other gains in relation to distributed funds or refunded Contributions.

8.3 Publication and sharing of personal data relating to Backers with Campaign Owners
(a) Unless you have selected the anonymous donation option, we publish the username of each Backer on the Campaign Profile Page and we share these details and each Backer’s full name and email address with the applicable Campaign Owner for them to fulfil your Reward and to contact you in relation to the Campaign. Please see our Privacy Policy for further details.
(b) For some Rewards, a Campaign Owner may need further information from Backers, (e.g. specific sizing and quantity information for particular items), to enable the Campaign Owner to deliver certain Rewards. The Campaign Owner shall request such information directly from a Backer after the end of the Fundraising Window for the relevant successful Campaign.
